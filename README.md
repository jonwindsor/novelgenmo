# Surelephanhiwake
A repository for the code of Surelephaniwake, a Python script developed for an assignment for Creative Coding (DGST 302) at the University of Mary Washington.

## Background and Function
Creating meaning out of confusion, Surelephaniwake, titled after a randomiize line from a mashed together version of Rudyard Kipling's 1894 novel Jungle Book, is a 110 page computer-generated novel. Using Jeremy Singer-Vine's [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) chain generator, taking a large section of corpora text (in this case, Kipling's novel) and generating randomized sentences. 

Sample page:

## Feats, Struggles, and Reflection
While [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) has the capacity to make legible language from the Jungle Book, I opted for illegible sentences as an artistic choice. I initially had difficulties exporting my coropa text into html with the accompanying format such as chapters, page numbers, and introductory pages. This was fixed in the second iteration of Surelephanhiwake, now printing properly. For future iterations, I would hope to have images included and further formatting changes.

## Changes and Improvements
 
  **12/9/21**
- Now prints properly in PDF format
- Formatting adjustments (added title page, chapters, and page numbers)
