# Surelephanhiwake
A repository for the code of Surelephaniwake, a Python script developed for an assignment for Creative Coding (DGST 302) at the University of Mary Washington.

## Background and Function
Creating meaning out of confusion, Surelephaniwake, titled after a line from a mashed together version of Rudyard Kipling's 1894 novel Jungle Book, is a 110 page computer-generated novel. Using Jeremy Singer-Vine's [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) chain generator, taking a large section of corpora text (in this case, Kipling's novel) and generating randomized sentences. 

Sample page:

## Feats, Struggles, and Reflection
While [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) has the capacity to make legible language from the Jungle Book, I opted for illegible sentences as an artistic choice. I had difficulties exporting my coropa text into html with the accompanying format such as chapters, page numbers, and introductory pages. For that reason, my code lacks the ability to export to PDF properly, and thus an external application had to be used in order to sucessfully produce the final product included in this repository. For future iterations, I hope to break the 110 pages into chapters, with page numbers, introductory pages, and a title page.
